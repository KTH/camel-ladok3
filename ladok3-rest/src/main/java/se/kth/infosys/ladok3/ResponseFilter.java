 * This is a client response filter that is set up to trace responses in {@link AbstractLadok3Service}

 * appropriately and crank up the log level for se.kth.infosys.ladok3 to trace level.
 *
 * <p>Tracing responses may be memory and cpu intensive due to the streams paradigm being
 * bypassed with the stream loaded into memory in full, logged, and a new stream generated
 * out of memory to the receiving application, depending on your payload.
